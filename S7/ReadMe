Session : 7
Objective : Train the CIFAR-10 Dataset and achieve accuracy of More than 80% on Conclusion Layer using below constraints.
     1. Architecture to C1C2C3C40 (basically 3 MPs) .
     2. Total Receptive Field must be more than 44.
     3. One of the layers must use Depthwise Separable Convolution.
     4. One of the layers must use Dilated Convolution.
     5. use GAP (compulsory):- add FC after GAP to target #of classes (optional) : ( ---- Not Used ---- )
     6. Achieve 80% accuracy, as many epochs as you want. Total Params to be less than 1M.


Acheived Accuracy = 78%
Used Image Augmentation
Number of Parameter : 995,710
Number Of Epoch = 25
