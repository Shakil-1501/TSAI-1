Session 6 Assignment Conclusion
------------------Testing Accuracy Analysis -------------------


Testing Accuracy Analysis is divided into 3 Parts :

1. L1 with BN and L2 With BN
2. L1 with GBN and L2 with GBN
3. L1_L2 with GBN and L1_l2 with BN

1. L1 with BN after 7th epoch more oscillation 
   whereas 
   L2 With BN before 7th Epoch having more Oscillation.

2. L1 with GBN After every Two epoch we  can observe Oscillation
   whereas
   L2 with GBN after 12th Epoch test accuracy is almost constant.

3. L1_L2 with GBN Most of the time it is oscillating and among-st of all , it is giving worst accuracy.
   whereas
   L1_l2 with BN given etter accuracy for most of the epoch compared with L1_L2 with GBN

  And L1_l2 with BN started with lower test accuracy and till reaching 25th Epoch gave better accuracy
  compared with L1_L2 with GBN


_---------------------------------------Loss Function Analysis -------------------------------

1.L1& L2 with BN fall is most steep among all.

2.L1 with BN has less oscillation than L2 with BN

3.L1 with GBN and L2 with GBN they both are euivalent in all the epochs but L1 with GBN wins at the end with lower losses.

4. L1 & L2 with BN and GBN they both are showing initial higher losses but became almost constant with no much fluctuations after some epochs
